        <p class="intro">
            I am Mahesh Guduru, currently pursuing a Masterâ€™s degree in Information Technology Management (ITM) at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee. My academic journey is fueled by a passion for technology and its application in business environments, with a strong foundation in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and IT management.

        <p>
            My academic focus is aligned with my career aspirations, aiming to leverage skills in AI, machine learning, and strategic IT management in technology and business sectors. During my undergraduate studies, I held the position of Director of Membership Head in the Rotaract Club of IIMC, conducted a Leadership Program for school children, and actively participated in various extracurricular activities. These experiences have honed my leadership, organizational, and problem-solving skills.

            I am committed to continuous personal and professional development, embracing new technologies, and applying innovative solutions to real-world business challenges.
